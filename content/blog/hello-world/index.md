Ok, so in true 2019 fashion I'm making a tech blog. This is mainly an 
excuse to use Gatsby. Talking about the stack, Gatsby is used for building
the blog. The whole thing is deployed on netlify.

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

In the mean time, if you want more to read up on,
check out [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)!

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for 
> a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target 
> for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling 
> deployment on the web for client and server applications.
